        Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! I'm a front-end developer with a passion
        for creating beautiful and intuitive web experiences. With 3 years of experience
        in the industry, I specialize in developing responsive, accessible, and user-friendly
        websites and web applications. My journey into web development began when
        I discovered my love for design and technology. I found that I could combine
        my creative skills with my technical abilities to bring digital products
        to life. Since then, I have been honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
        as well as front-end frameworks like React and Angular.
